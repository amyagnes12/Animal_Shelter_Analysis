# Animal Shelter Analysis by Ayoung Kim (Solo)
## The overview of the animal shelter analaysis
- I have a cat named Frederick, whom I adopted from the local sheler. Ever since, I have been interested in animals in the shelter so I wanted to analyze animals in shelters. I found data from Austin Animal Center on Kaggle related to shelter animals, which contained data on animals at the center.

- With this dataset, I want to create various visualizations to show the different trends of animals at the shelter -- for example, trends of animals entering and leaving the shelter. I also want to find a best machine learning model to predict the status of the animals based on other factors.  
- Clean Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv file using Pandas-> clean Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv file using Pandas -> Create tables for intakes and outcomes and join two tables in SQL -> Create machine learning model with clean data -> Create multiple visualizations in Tableau
