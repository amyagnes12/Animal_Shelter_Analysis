# Animal Shelter Analysis (Cat) by Ayoung Kim (Solo)
## The overview of the animal shelter analaysis
- I have a cat named Frederick, whom I adopted from the local shelter. Ever since, I have been interested in animals in the shelter so I wanted to analyze the information about animals in the shelters. I found data from Austin Animal Center on Kaggle related to shelter animals, which contained data on animals at the center. The shelter data was large but many were messy and requiring some form of data cleaning (ex. dog breeds spanned across hundreds of different breeds). However data on cats was the least messy so I decided to focus on cat data for this analysis.

- With this dataset, I want to create various visualizations to show the different trends of cats at the shelter -- for example, trends of cats entering and leaving the shelter. I also want to find a best machine learning model to predict the status of the cats based on other factors.  
- Clean Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv file using Pandas-> clean Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv file using Pandas -> Create tables for intakes and outcomes and join two tables in SQL -> Create machine learning model with clean data -> Create multiple visualizations in Tableau
